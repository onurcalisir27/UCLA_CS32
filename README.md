# UCLA CS32: Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains projects and homework assignments completed for the UCLA CS32 course, "Data Structures and Algorithms." The course focuses on data abstraction, algorithm analysis, and object-oriented programming principles. Students learn to construct larger, more complex programs while exploring advanced data structures and algorithms.

## Course Objectives
- Employ data abstraction to design and construct larger programs.
- Understand and utilize various data structures to solve computational problems.
- Analyze and choose appropriate algorithms and data structures for specific problems.
- Deepen understanding of modern programming principles, including object-oriented and generic programming.

## Contents
The repository is organized into two main sections:
1. **Projects**: Four major programming projects focused on implementing data structures and algorithms.
2. **Homework**: Four assignments designed to reinforce understanding of course material.

## Structure
Each project and homework folder contains:
- **Source Code**: C++ files implementing the solution.
- **README**: A brief description of the task, approach, and key learnings.

## Skills Developed
- Advanced problem-solving using data structures and algorithms.
- Understanding and applying principles of object-oriented programming.
- Designing efficient solutions through algorithm analysis and data abstraction.
