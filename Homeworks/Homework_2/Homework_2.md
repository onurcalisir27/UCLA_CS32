# Homework 2: Logical Expressions and Maze Pathfinding

This homework consists of two major tasks: evaluating logical expressions and finding paths in a maze using different data structures (stack and queue). These tasks emphasize algorithmic thinking and the use of fundamental C++ STL data structures.

## Objectives
- Implement and evaluate logical expressions with proper operator precedence.
- Explore the difference between stack-based depth-first search (DFS) and queue-based breadth-first search (BFS) in a maze.
- Understand and implement custom algorithms using STL containers.

## Features
1. **Logical Expression Evaluation**:
   - Converts infix expressions to postfix for easier computation.
   - Evaluates logical expressions with operators `!`, `&`, and `^` (NOT, AND, XOR).
   - Handles errors like mismatched parentheses or invalid syntax.

2. **Maze Pathfinding**:
   - Implements two algorithms for solving a maze:
     - **DFS using Stack** (`mazestack.cpp`): Explores one path fully before backtracking.
     - **BFS using Queue** (`mazequeue.cpp`): Explores all possible paths equally before moving further.
   - Compares the efficiency and application of stack-based and queue-based approaches.

## File Descriptions
1. **`eval.cpp`**:
   - Implements logical expression evaluation.
   - Converts infix expressions to postfix and evaluates them using a stack.

2. **`mazestack.cpp`**:
   - Implements DFS for solving a maze using a stack.
   - Explores deeper paths before backtracking to find a solution.

3. **`mazequeue.cpp`**:
   - Implements BFS for solving a maze using a queue.
   - Explores all possible moves in breadth-first order for shortest pathfinding.

4. **`hw.txt`**:
   - Contains the analysis of the first 12 coordinates popped by both stack and queue approaches, highlighting the differences between DFS and BFS.
