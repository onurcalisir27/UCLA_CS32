# Project 2: Sequence - Custom Doubly Linked List

This project implements a custom doubly linked list in C++ to create a flexible and efficient `Sequence` class. The class supports various operations like insertion, deletion, subsequence detection, and concatenation, providing hands-on experience with data structures and pointer manipulation.

## Objectives
- Learn how to design and implement a doubly linked list from scratch.
- Understand pointer manipulation and memory management.
- Implement advanced list operations like subsequence detection and concatenation with reverse.

## Features
1. **Dynamic List Operations**:
   - Insert elements at specific positions.
   - Erase elements by position or value.
   - Retrieve or modify elements at specific positions.

2. **Advanced Functionalities**:
   - Find subsequences within a list.
   - Concatenate two sequences while reversing one.
   - Support for dynamic resizing without predefined limits.

3. **Robust Design**:
   - Custom `Node` struct for doubly linked list implementation.
   - Non-member functions for enhanced functionality.

## File Descriptions
1. **`Sequence.h`**:
   - Header file for the `Sequence` class.
   - Defines the interface for list operations and non-member functions like `subsequence` and `concatReverse`.

2. **`Sequence.cpp`**:
   - Implements the `Sequence` class and its member functions.
   - Includes detailed pointer manipulation logic for list operations.

## Skills Developed
  - Implementing custom data structures with dynamic memory management.
  - Debugging complex pointer-based algorithms.
  - Designing efficient algorithms for sequence manipulation.
